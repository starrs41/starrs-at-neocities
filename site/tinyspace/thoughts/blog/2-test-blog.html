            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <p>
                    Hello!! Here's a blog dedicated to testing out some features I want to use on the blog pages. 
                    Right now, you're looking at a paragraph. The paragraphs on this site are normally justified.
                    It looks pretty simple, doesn't it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, let's try adding some flavor to the text! This is <b>bold</b> and <strong>important</strong> text.
                    This is <i>italic</i> and <em>emphasized</em> text. This is what a <a>link</a> looks like, though you already 
                    probably knew that since you came from tiny space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>But wait!</b> What about the <em>other</em> features of the site? Let's head on over to headings!
                </p>
                <h2 class="o-blog-heading">Blog Headings</h2>
                <p>
                    ...Well, that's it. The one above me is a heading (and one with the h2 tags, to be exact) and it'll probably be the
                    only other kind of heading I'll use on the blog pages besides the actual title of the blog (which uses the h1 tags).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a little simpler compared to the other headings found around tiny space, but it'll do!
                </p>
                <h2 class="o-blog-heading">Lists</h2>
                <p>
                    Now for lists!
                    Fun fact: I gave the lists rainbow bullets, but the effect is only visible when there are a lot of
                    items in the list. That RARELY happens though, so... I guess we'll never see the full potential of these lists... :']
                </p>
                <p>
                    This applies not only to lists in blog pages, but to every list across tiny space as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    An unordered list would look like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>three</li>
                    <li>two</li>
                    <li>one</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ...and an ordered list would look like this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>one</li>
                    <li>two</li>
                    <li>three</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="o-blog-heading">Images</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's try adding some images!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Images can have captions, but when compiling multiple images into one photo set, they cannot have individual captions. They can share one caption, though. (Why? Because I said so :P) 
                    You could have one caption for all of them, though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's what one photo looks like with and without a caption.
                </p>
                <div class="o-blog-image">
                    <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>This is an image with a caption, but it's also possible for it to have no caption!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="o-blog-image">
                    <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 50%;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here's what it looks like when there are multiple images, also with and without captions
                </p>

                <div class="o-blog-image">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                    </div>
                    <p>These images have captions!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="o-blog-image">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/misc/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    (Yes, it's this placeholder image again.)
                </p>
                <h2 class="o-blog-heading">Code Blocks</h2>
                <p>
                    The code block looks pretty simple. In fact, it doesn't have any syntax highlighting at the moment.
                    Unfortunately, it takes a while to color some text manually, which is why there isn't any right now. I might try adding
                    some colors the next time I use it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (And besides, if I ever need to show how certain HTML, CSS, and Javascript is done, I could also use <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. ^^;)
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
name = input("What is your name?: ")
message = "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(message)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Can you guess what programming language I used? (Hint: It starts with "P"! >:])
                </p>
                <p>
                    On mobile devices, scroll bars will be added to the code block, so don't worry! You'll still be 
                    able to read the code just fine... I think.
                </p>

                <h2 class="o-blog-heading">Blockquotes</h2>

                <p>
                    Okay, to be honest, I'm not sure when I'll use this. I thought it would be fun to code this feature,
                    so I guess it exists now ^^;
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's what a blockquote looks like.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="o-quote-text">
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec venenatis nec eros semper vulputate. Etiam.
                    </p>
                    <p class="o-quote-author">
                        Some guy
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Simple, right? That's pretty much it ^^;
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
                    That's all for now! Thank you for taking the time to read this article, even though it was mostly for me to test 
                    things, haha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See you around! Until next time! :]
                </p>
