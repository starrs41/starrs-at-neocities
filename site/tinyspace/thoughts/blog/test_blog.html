                <p>
                    Hello!! Here's a blog dedicated to testing out some features I want to use on the blog pages. 
                    Right now, you're looking at a paragraph. The paragraphs on this site are normally justified.
                    It looks pretty simple, doesn't it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, let's try adding some flavor to the text! This is <b>bold</b> and <strong>important</strong> text.
                    This is <i>italic</i> and <em>emphasized</em> text. This is what a <a>link</a> looks like, though you already 
                    probably knew that since you came from tiny space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>But wait!</b> What about the <em>other</em> features of the site? Let's head on over to headings!
                </p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Blog Headings</h2>
                <p>
                    ...Well, that's it. The one above me is a heading (an h2 one, to be exact) and it'll probably be the
                    only other kind of heading I'll use on the blog pages besides the actual title of the blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a little more simpler compared to the other headings found around tiny space, but it'll do!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stars are removed on mobile devices, though. ^^; (I won't be able to figure out how to make it look nice otherwise!)
                </p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Lists</h2>
                <p>
                    Now for lists!
                    Fun fact: I gave the lists rainbow bullets, but the effect is only visible when there are a lot of
                    items in the list. That RARELY happens though, so... I guess we'll never see the full potential of these lists... :')
                </p>
                <p>
                    This applies not only to lists in blog pages, but to every list across tiny space as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    An unordered list would look like this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>three</li>
                    <li>two</li>
                    <li>one</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ...and an ordered list would look like this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>one</li>
                    <li>two</li>
                    <li>three</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Images</h2>
                <p>
                    With that out of the way, let's try adding some images!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Images can be added with or without captions, but multiple images in a row won't be able to have individual captions. (Why? Because I said so :P) 
                    You could have one caption for all of them, though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Though to be honest, I don't feel like I'll put a lot of pictures anyway ^^;)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's what one photo looks like with and without a caption.
                </p>
                <div class="middle-img">
                    <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 50%;">
                    <p>This is an image with a caption, but it's also possible for it to have no caption!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="middle-img">
                    <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 50%;">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here's what it looks like when there are multiple images, also with and without captions
                </p>

                <div class="middle-img">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                    </div>
                    <p>These images have captions!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="middle-img">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="/graphics/others/characters/placeholder.png" style="width: 30%;">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Sorry for showing you the same image multiple times, I'm sure you're tired of seeing it by now 
                    (it is the placeholder image, after all...) ^^;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, in case you were wondering, the photos are also responsive and will grow to fit your screen on smaller devices!
                    Cool, huh? :D
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, there's another feature I want to show. Let's move on to code blocks!
                </p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Code Blocks</h2>
                <p>
                    The code block looks pretty simple. In fact, it doesn't have any syntax highlighting at the moment. Sorry about that. ^^;
                    Unfortunately, it takes a while to color manually, which is why it doesn't have any color at the moment. I might try adding
                    some colors the next time I use it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    (And besides, if I ever need to show how certain HTML, CSS, and Javascript is done, I could also use <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. ^^;)
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
name = input("What is your name?: ")
message = "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(message)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Can you guess what programming language I used? (Hint: It starts with "P"! >:D)
                </p>
                <p>
                    On mobile devices, scroll bars will be added to the code block, so don't worry! You'll still be 
                    able to read the code just fine... I think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's move on to the last feature: blockquotes!
                </p>

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Blockquotes</h2>

                <p>
                    Okay, to be honest, I'm not sure when I'll use this. But it's better to be prepared, so...! Let's jump into it!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's what a blockquote looks like.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec venenatis nec eros semper vulputate. Etiam.
                    </p>
                    <figcaption>Some guy</figcaption>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Pretty simple, right? That's pretty much all there is to it ^^;
                </p>
                <p>
                    For inline quotes, I'm not sure whether I should style them differently or not. But here's what I have for now.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
                    That's all for now! Thank you for taking the time to read this article, even though it was mostly for me to test 
                    things, haha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See you around! Until next time! :D
                </p>
